### Hello There!
I am a high school student currently making spigot/bukkit plugins and basically anything in C# for fun. I taught myself java about a year ago and have been obsessed ever since. Feel free to reach out to me via my discord server or email (carson.thackston@gmail.com) if you need to.  
  
I currently know java and I'm learning C#. 
  
I have released one spigot plugin, SimpleCurrencies.  
  
My discord is https://https://discord.gg/yq76UKS. Feel free to join!
